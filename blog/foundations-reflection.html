          Utilising your journal findings and the high-level overview of the
          Core learnings you have covered in Foundations - answer each of the
          following questions:
        </p>
        <p class="title">
          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the core learning?
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            My self-belief and self-doubt run remarkably deep. Despite this
            incredible opportunity to join a bootcamp and transform my life,
            I've found myself grappling with self-doubt and engaging in
            unnecessary comparisons with others. It's as if I constantly place
            myself at a lower level, questioning my abilities even after
            completing challenges successfully.
          </li>
          <li>
            I have an insatiable desire to excel and be recognized for my
            efforts. The need for external validation often lingers, and I'm
            frequently haunted by doubts about whether I genuinely grasp a
            concept or skill. It's a perpetual quest for self-assurance.
          </li>
          <li>
            I thought I had a growth mindset, but it appears I have more to
            explore in this area. This revelation has been unsettling because I
            thought I was making significant progress in personal growth and
            self-improvement.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="title">
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding values, I've noticed that my commitment to honesty and
          helpfulness sometimes has its drawbacks. Self-doubt creeps in, leading
          to constant comparisons with others. My honesty can also make me
          overly reliant on seeking permission from others. Empathy-wise, I wish
          I could extend the same compassion to myself as I do to others.
          Believing in myself is an ongoing challenge, and I'm working on being
          more understanding and supportive during moments of self-doubt.
          Self-awareness is a strength of mine, perhaps even to a fault. Now,
          I'm striving to channel this self-awareness more positively, shifting
          from dwelling on negatives to fostering positive self-reflection and
          growth.

          What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
        </p>
        <p>
          What truly surprised me was the inclusion of core learning in this
          programming course. It's heartening to see a curriculum that
          recognizes the human aspect alongside technical skills. The
          recommendation of journaling and meditation as tools for programmers
          was particularly unexpected but highly beneficial. It taps into the
          emotional and less rational aspects of learning, which may seem
          incongruent with the logic-driven world of programming but is
          undeniably valuable.
        </p>
        <p class="title">
          What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        </p>
        <p>
          The most demanding aspect of core learning has been maintaining the
          commitments I outlined for myself. Although I've successfully adhered
          to my morning meditation and journaling routine, I've struggled with
          other aspects, such as connecting with nature as planned.
          Additionally, I believe there's room for improvement in my journaling,
          as I often remain at the surface level rather than delving into deeper
          reflections.
        </p>
        <p class="title">
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </p>
        <p>
          The focus on core learning is essential because programming is not
          solely about writing code; it encompasses the individuals behind the
          code. Factors like emotional well-being, problem-solving abilities,
          and resilience profoundly impact a programmer's success. Integrating
          tools that address these human elements prepares students for the
          multifaceted challenges of real-world programming. By emphasizing core
          learning, the school ensures that students become well-rounded and
          adaptable developers.
        </p>
        <p class="title">
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
          instead? Justify your answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Absolutely not. The time invested in core learning has been
          invaluable. While it has presented its share of challenges, it has
          been an essential part of my journey. Core learning has provided
          profound insights into my thought processes and behaviors, directly
          influencing my programming journey. Understanding how I approach
          challenges and how to channel self-doubt into growth enhances my
          capacity to learn and apply programming skills effectively. So, far
          from being a futile endeavor, it has been an enriching, albeit
          occasionally challenging, experience.
