          Hey there! Let's chat about something interesting in web design, but
          we'll keep it simple, I promise!
        </p>
        <p class="title">Classes:</p>
        <p>
          Think of a class like a label you can stick on things on a webpage,
          like photos in an album. This label helps you group and style several
          things in the same way. It's like saying, "All these photos get a
          special frame." You can use this label many times on different parts
          of the page.
        </p>
        <p class="title">When to use classes:</p>
        <p>
          Use classes when you want to make lots of things look the same, like
          giving a bunch of paragraphs the same text color or background. It
          keeps your web design organized and tidy.
        </p>
        <p class="title">IDs:</p>
        <p>
          IDs: Now, an ID is like a super special label, kind of like a name tag
          for just one thing on the page. This label is unique, meaning it's
          only used once in the whole webpage. You use an ID when you want to
          make one thing really stand out, like saying, "This is the main
          heading, and it's going to be big and bold!"
        </p>
        <p class="title">When to use IDs:</p>
        <p>
          When to use IDs: Use IDs when you have something unique that you want
          to style differently or when you need to use some fancy programming
          magic (JavaScript), like making a button do something special when you
          click it.
        </p>
        <p class="title">But here's the <span id="catch">catch:</span></p>
        <p>
          Don't go overboard with IDs. Using too many unique labels can make
          your webpage harder to manage, like having too many names for things
          in your house. For things that are kind of similar, classes are your
          go-to, just like using the same label for similar items in your
          collection. They make things easier to keep track of!
        </p>

        <p>
          You can see in the following two screenshots, that I've added a class
          of "title" to all my paragraph headings. The styling set in the CSS
          file will then be applied to all of these, so they look exactly the
          same across the page. But notice, I also created an id specifically
          for the word "catch".

          <img
            src="/images/class and id html.jpg"
            alt="image showing html file with class and id elements"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          This allows me to target just the word catch, and change its styling
          so it looks different from the rest and helps grab your attention!<br />

          <img
            src="/images/class and id css  2.jpg"
            alt="image showing css file with class and id styled elements"
          />
        </p>

        <p>
          In conclusion, understanding the power of classes and IDs in web
          design can be a game-changer, even if you're not a coding wizard.
          Classes and IDs help you keep your web projects tidy, efficient, and
          visually appealing. Remember, classes are your trusty labels for
          things that share common traits, making your styling consistent and
          manageable. IDs, on the other hand, are like VIP badges for those
          unique elements that deserve individual treatment or require some
          special JavaScript
          <span id="catch">magic.</span> So, go ahead, apply these best
          practices, and watch your web designs come to life with style and
          efficiency. Happy coding and designing!
