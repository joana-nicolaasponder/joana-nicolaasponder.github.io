          Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
          how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
          you made, and how you reflect on the decision now. (eg, a cashier gave
          you too much change backâ€¦what do you do? Ethical decision is asking
          whether our action is right or wrong)
        </p>
        <p>
          When reflecting on ethical decisions I've made, I've found that
          there's often no internal debate. Whether it's returning a lost
          wallet, correcting an incorrect charge at a restaurant, or addressing
          a cashier's error, my immediate response has consistently been one of
          honesty and integrity. While I may briefly consider the possibility of
          not speaking up, I quickly prioritize the potential impact on others.
          I understand that my actions can affect their job security and
          well-being, reinforcing my commitment to doing the right thing.
          Looking back, I always feel that returning the wallet or addressing
          the mistake was the right choice.

          Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
          your values and identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Growing up in Brazilian culture, I've absorbed its warmth,
          friendliness, and kindness. These values have shaped my own
          personality, making me inclined to help others. Family has also been a
          cornerstone of my life due to the stability it provided during our
          international moves. The breakdown of my family unit deeply affected
          me, reinforcing the importance of family and expressing love for those
          I care about.

          Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.
        </p>

        <p>
          My strengths, including curiosity, hard work ethic, resourcefulness,
          and a desire to assist others, will be valuable assets on my learning
          journey. Curiosity drives my exploration of new concepts, while
          resourcefulness allows me to find solutions to challenges.

          Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
          development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        </p>
        <p>
          Staying focused, especially when encountering resistance or
          difficulty, can be challenging for me. Remote learning poses
          additional accountability hurdles. Moreover, I recognize that
          self-belief is an area where I need improvement. Negative self-talk
          can undermine confidence, but I am actively working on addressing this
          limitation and building a more positive mindset.
        </p>

        <p class="title">
          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.
        </p>
        <p>
          In group settings, my inclination to avoid conflict and please others
          has sometimes led me to withhold my ideas or opinions, even when they
          could benefit the team. I've realized that collaboration thrives on
          diverse perspectives and ideas. I've grown in this regard,
          particularly through experiences in improvisational theatre. It has
          taught me the value of each team member's contribution and how our
          collective ideas build something greater together. Nowadays, I'm more
          willing to offer my insights to ensure a richer outcome, but it is
          still something I'm actively working on.
        </p>

        <p>
          These reflections highlight the influence of culture and personal
          experiences on my values and identity, and the strengths and
          limitations that will shape my learning journey and interactions with
          others. Remote work and communication through platforms like
          Discord/Slack align better with my introverted nature. While I enjoy
          being social, I also value personal time to recharge. Virtual
          communication allows me to balance social interaction with solitude
          more effectively, contributing to my overall productivity and
          well-being.
