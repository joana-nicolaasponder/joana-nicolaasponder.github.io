          Embarking on a journey in the world of programming and tech feels like
          stepping into a vast and ever-evolving landscape. This post will take
          you through my personal exploration, from my, still, evolving career
          aspirations to the strengths and challenges that shape my learning
          experience. I'll share how I plan to manage the demands of a tech
          bootcamp, what support I expect from the facilitation team, all while
          balancing the responsibilities of parenthood. This is the story of my
          journey as an aspiring coder, eager to navigate the intricate world of
          technology, one step at a time.

        <p class="heading">My Bootcamp Learning Plan</p>
        <p class="title">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</p>
        <p>
          I'm still quite uncertain about exactly what it is I want to go into.
          There is also an ongoing uncertainty surrounding my family's future in
          New Zealand (possibly relocating in early 2024) that also hinders my
          thought process in terms of what opportunities are available, and
          maybe what company I would potentially like to work for, or what
          industry, since I we don't know exactly where we will go. I think
          right now, I'm quite excited about becoming an actual software
          developer in general, maybe developing apps. I've got a couple of
          personal project ideas that I'd love to work on short term to also
          keep up my skills, especially if we do end up moving and it takes a
          lot longer for me to actually settle and find a job.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a drive to create things, as there is this sort of "artist"
          living inside me. But I haven't seemed to find the right pathway in
          terms of creation for me yet. And I'm starting to think, maybe
          development is it. My overarching aspiration is to create something
          meaningful, like an app that positively impacts others' lives. If
          something I created was able to help someone else, that would be so
          freaking amazing.
        </p>
        <p>
          On a more general level, the impact I want to make personally and to
          my family is that I get a job that allows me to work remotely. That
          isn't dependent on a location, and that allows us to have a bit more
          flexibility in our lives. I'd love to make money so that I feel
          personally financially stable, and that I feel like I can contribute
          equally to the household income. I know it's not necessary (and I'm
          lucky to be in such a position), but it would be awesome if I felt
          like I was contributing equally in a financial way.
        </p>
        <p>
          A dream of mine is also to develop a video game with my brother. We've
          discussed this often, and would love to make this a reality. However,
          I don't think for either of us it would be a full time job, rather a
          passion project.
        </p>
        <p class="title">
          What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
          Bootcamp?
        </p>
        <p>
          My biggest strengths will be curiosity/desire to learn, hard work
          ethic, and a desire to assist others. However, as I have learned
          throughout Foundations, the desire to assist others might also be a
          limitation, where in a negative way I compare myself to others and
          their journey and skills. Comparison and self doubt will be my biggest
          limitation.
        </p>
        <p class="title">
          What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
          will be?
        </p>
        <p>
          I think my biggest non-technical challenge will be not burning out.
          I'm not going to lie, I had a few moments (at the end of Sprint 4 and
          5) that I felt like I was done. There was just nothing that I could
          produce anymore, my brain felt full, and I literally told my brother
          "I wish there was someone here to take care of me..." Don't get me
          wrong, I am supported here, my partner is doing a great job picking up
          the slack with the toddler, but...I am still the caretaker. It's part
          of my personality (my ennegream is type 2, i'm an INFJ...it's built
          into me to help and take care of others...sometimes at the expense of
          myself). I still am doing just as much as I was before I started this
          program, to keep up the household, keep everyone fed, etc.
          Additionally, the uncertainty surrounding a potential move in 2024 has
          been mentally taxing. I often start the week strongly but feel
          depleted by Thursday or Friday. I recognize the need to prioritize
          sleep, but I struggle with it as I use video games as a form of
          self-care, sometimes staying up late and accumulating sleep debt
          (which significantly affects my resiliency and ability to focus).
        </p>

        <p class="title">
          What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </p>
        <p>
          I would love to develop my skills in giving and receiving feedback,
          and developing some leadership skills. I think both of these will be
          really helpful in also me moving away from self-doubt and comparison.
          I believe to be an effective leader, you must be confident in yourself
          but also confident in others. And you can't be confident if you're
          doubting yourself and comparing yourself to others.
        </p>
        <p class="title">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</p>
        <p>
          My expectations from the Bootcamp team are the same as the ones I had
          from the Foundations team. I expect the team to monitor students'
          progress and intervene if they notice someone falling behind
          significantly. I anticipate a supportive learning environment with
          clear guidance and constructive feedback.
        </p>
        <p class="title">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</p>
        <p>
          I'm really happy to know that we have a weekly 1:1 with the Human
          Skills facilitator and the Tech Ins, and will use this time to address
          any concerns. I feel like I'm pretty good at reaching out for help
          when necessary, and when I feel overwhelmed I'll reach out for
          guidance and support. My commitments during Bootcamp remain largely
          the same as they did during Foundations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I commit to attending daily sessions and will use time-tracking
            tools like Toggl and the Pomodoro technique to stay focused.
          </li>
          <li>
            I'll maintain self-awareness and set clear goals to manage
            distractions effectively.
          </li>
          <li>
            I pledge to actively engage with facilitators, peers, and community
            members, assuming positive intent in feedback and collaboration.
          </li>
          <li>
            To prevent issues from building up, I'll seek help proactively when
            needed, recognizing that the bootcamp's success depends on my active
            participation.

        <p class="title">Strengths and Limitations in Learning:</p>
        <p>
          I possess strengths like curiosity, passion, creativity, and a love
          for learning new things. However, my weaknesses include a tendency
          towards perfectionism, which can lead to burnout, sensitivity to
          criticism when it feels like my ideas aren't understood, and being
          easily distracted when fatigued.
        </p>

        <p class="title">Skills Development:</p>
        <p>
          During my time at Dev Academy, I aspire to build my confidence and
          reduce self-criticism and self-doubt.
        </p>
        <p class="title">Workload Management Commitment:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            I commit to attending daily sessions and will use time-tracking
            tools like Toggl and the Pomodoro technique to stay focused.
          </li>
          <li>
            I'll maintain self-awareness and set clear goals to manage
            distractions effectively.
          </li>
          <li>
            I pledge to actively engage with facilitators, peers, and community
            members, assuming positive intent in feedback and collaboration.
          </li>
          <li>
            To prevent issues from building up, I'll seek help proactively when
            needed, recognizing that the bootcamp's success depends on my active
            participation.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="title">Seeking Help:</p>
        <p>
          When facing challenges or feeling overwhelmed, I will reach out to a
          facilitator for guidance and support. I understand the importance of
          countering my tendency to create negative scenarios in my mind with
          factual information and appreciate positive reinforcement to combat
          perfectionism and potential burnout.
        </p>
        <p class="title">Expectations from Facilitation Team:</p>
        <p>
          I expect the facilitation team to monitor students' progress and
          intervene if they notice someone falling behind significantly. I
          anticipate a supportive learning environment with clear guidance and
          constructive feedback.
        </p>
        <p class="title">Scheduling Information:</p>
        <p>
          I have family commitments, including caring for my toddler. My
          block-out times are from 5:30 PM to 9:00 PM for evening routines and
          family time, as well as mornings until around 8:30 AM for household
          responsibilities. My partner will handle drop-offs and pickups for
          daycare, but if my toddler becomes sick and demands attention, I will
          work from the nearby library to maintain focus and productivity. I'm
          also prepared to work on projects after my son goes to bed, and before
          he wakes up, when necessary.
