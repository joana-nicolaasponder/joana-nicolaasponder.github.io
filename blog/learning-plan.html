          Embarking on a journey in the world of programming and tech feels like
      stepping into a vast and ever-evolving landscape. This post will take you
      through my personal exploration, from my, still, evolving career
      aspirations to the strengths and challenges that shape my learning
      experience. I'll share how I plan to manage the demands of a tech
      bootcamp, what support I expect from the facilitation team, all while
      balancing the responsibilities of parenthood. This is the story of my
      journey as an aspiring coder, eager to navigate the intricate world of
      technology, one step at a time.
        </p>
        <p class="title">Long-Term Career Pathway:</p>
        <p>
          My career path in programming and coding is still evolving, and I'm
          exploring various options within the tech industry. Initially, I aimed to
          become a programmer through a bootcamp, but I've since discovered a
          broader range of opportunities, such as Product Management, which piqued
          my interest. Ultimately, my goal is to work remotely, enjoying the
          flexibility it offers, and achieve financial stability. I'm also motivated
          by the desire to make a meaningful impact in whatever role I pursue.
          Additionally, I have a side goal of developing a game with my brother,
          though it's not my primary career focus.
        </p>
        <p class="title">Strengths and Limitations in Learning:</p>
        <p>
          I possess strengths like curiosity, passion, creativity, and a love for
          learning new things. However, my weaknesses include a tendency towards
          perfectionism, which can lead to burnout, sensitivity to criticism when it
          feels like my ideas aren't understood, and being easily distracted when
          fatigued.
        </p>
    
        <p class="title">Skills Development:</p>
        <p>
          During my time at Dev Academy, I aspire to build my confidence and reduce
          self-criticism and self-doubt.
        </p>
        <p class="title">Workload Management Commitment:</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>I commit to attending daily sessions and will use time-tracking tools
          like Toggl and the Pomodoro technique to stay focused.</li>
          <li> I'll maintain
          self-awareness and set clear goals to manage distractions effectively.</li>
          <li>I
          pledge to actively engage with facilitators, peers, and community members,
          assuming positive intent in feedback and collaboration. </li>
          <li>To prevent
          issues from building up, I'll seek help proactively when needed,
          recognizing that the bootcamp's success depends on my active
          participation.</li>
          </ul>
          
        </p>
        <p class="title">Seeking Help:</p>
        <p>
          When facing challenges or feeling overwhelmed, I will reach out to a
          facilitator for guidance and support. I understand the importance of
          countering my tendency to create negative scenarios in my mind with
          factual information and appreciate positive reinforcement to combat
          perfectionism and potential burnout.
        </p>
        <p class="title">Expectations from Facilitation Team:</p>
        <p>
          I expect the facilitation team to monitor students' progress and intervene
          if they notice someone falling behind significantly. I anticipate a
          supportive learning environment with clear guidance and constructive
          feedback.
        </p>
        <p class="title">Scheduling Information:</p>
        <p>
          I have family commitments, including caring for my toddler. My block-out
          times are from 5:30 PM to 9:00 PM for evening routines and family time, as
          well as mornings until around 8:30 AM for household responsibilities. My
          partner will handle drop-offs and pickups for daycare, but if my toddler
          becomes sick and demands attention, I will work from the nearby library to
          maintain focus and productivity. I'm also prepared to work on projects
          after my son goes to bed, and before he wakes up, when necessary.
