        <p class="title">Or, as my three year old calls it, "Poooiiiiinnggg"</p>
        <p>
          I love games—board games, video games, made-up games. I remember as a
          kid, I once made an entire board game (though I wish I remembered what
          it was) and crafted all the little cards and pieces. I have fond
          memories of my brother and me playing video games together as kids
          (and even now as adults). My dream has always been to be a part of the
          games industry in some way, whether as a journalist, a streamer, or a
          developer. It wasn’t until I started a coding bootcamp that I thought,
          “Maybe I could learn to develop games.” And so, here I am, teaching
          myself how to use Godot. Maybe one day, I’ll develop that dream game.
          Who knows!
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the first roadblocks I hit when learning Godot was deciding
          where to start. With so many tutorials out there, I often found myself
          paralyzed by choice, trying to pick the “perfect” one instead of just
          diving in. Eventually, I discovered a tutorial by
          <a href="https://www.gdquest.com">GDQuest</a>, which was great for
          introducing me to the Godot Engine. But after completing it, I didn’t
          feel like I had truly grasped the concepts beyond copying and pasting
          code. So, I did what many of us do—I went on Reddit. There, I stumbled
          upon the
          <a href="https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io">20 Games Challenge.</a>
          This challenge was exactly what I needed: some structure to keep me on
          track without being a step-by-step walkthrough. The challenge provided
          definitions of done for each game, leaving me to figure out how to
          achieve those goals. The first game on the list: Pong.
        </p>

        <p class="title">Day 1: Building the Basics</p>
        <p>
          I got further than expected on Day 1. I broke the game down into
          smaller parts and started with creating the game area, including walls
          and a net. I used StaticBody2D nodes for the walls and added collision
          shapes so the ball could bounce off them. Next, I created the player
          paddle using a CharacterBody2D with its own collision shape, since it
          needed to move with user input. To make the paddle move, I figured out
          how to constrain its movement to the y-axis within the game window,
          ensuring it wouldn’t move out of bounds. Setting up user input was
          straightforward, involving just a couple of if statements to control
          movement with the W and S keys. Success!
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, I moved on to creating the ball using a RigidBody2D. I wrote a
          simple script to make the ball move and bounce off the paddles and
          walls. The ball physics worked well at first, but I encountered issues
          later. I also added a second paddle, but it didn’t behave as expected.
          Despite my efforts, the paddle could move out of bounds at the bottom
          and didn’t reach the top of the game area. I decided to tackle this
          issue the next day as it was time to pick up my son from daycare.
        </p>
        <p class="title">Day 2: Adding Features</p>
        <p>
          I was excited to get back to it. I really noticed I was getting into
          that flow state, and it was something I had been missing the past few
          months. I love learning, and I love how direct the feedback is when
          you’re coding. You can immediately see whether or not something is
          working as expected. I was really enjoying this.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a fresh mind, I quickly identified and fixed the issue with the
          second paddle. Now, both paddles were working, and the ball was
          bouncing correctly. I then created a restart scene, as my partner
          suggested, since the ball wasn’t resetting yet. Implementing the
          restart menu was straightforward: the game checks if the ball goes out
          of bounds and triggers the UI menu with a restart button.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, I tackled scoring. While the score tracker worked, it was
          pointless without a proper ball reset mechanism. I spent most of Day 2
          and Day 3 trying to fix this. Despite numerous attempts and debugging,
          I couldn’t resolve why the ball would reset out of bounds after a few
          successful resets. Even ChatGPT’s suggestions didn’t work.
          Fortunately, the 20 Games Challenge Discord came to the rescue. A
          fellow participant not only provided revised code but also explained
          why my approach wasn’t working. Understanding that RigidBody2D can
          exhibit unusual behavior when modifying position and velocity directly
          helped me resolve the issue. The ball reset beautifully after updating
          the code.

        <p class="title">Day 3: Refining the Game</p>
        <p>
          On Day 3, I updated the score tracker and implemented a game over
          screen that triggers when a player reaches 10 points. This was simpler
          than I expected, accomplished with a simple if/else statement.

            <input type="checkbox" id="item5" checked disabled /><label
              for="item5"
              >Track and display the score for each player.</label
            >
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With these goals met, the game was technically complete. I still had
          some stretch goals like adding sound and an AI paddle. I attempted to
          add sound effects for when the ball hits the paddle, but I encountered
          an issue. Currently, the game plays a “poing” sound when the game over
          screen appears, a sound lovingly provided by my son. For now, I’m
          calling it DONE.

        <p class="title">Final Thoughts:</p>

        <p>
          This project was incredibly rewarding. I was thrilled to see a
          semi-working version of Pong and couldn’t wait to share it with my
          family. Watching my partner and my three-year-old son play the game,
          even in its rough state, and hearing them laugh was the best feeling.
          My son’s enthusiastic “Wow, this is cool!” was priceless and made all
          the effort worthwhile. I look forward to the day when I can create a
          fully original game for him to enjoy. This experience has reinforced
          the joy of problem-solving, the value of community support, and the
          importance of taking breaks. I’m excited to continue learning and
          developing new games.
