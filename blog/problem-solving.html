          During this sprint we were presented with several short JavaScript
          challenges (katas). Not only was this meant to help us strengthen our
          skill in JavaScript, it also helped us understand our approach to
          problem solving. Here are some of my thoughts!
        </p>
        <p class="title">
          Conquering the Mind-Boggling Object Manipulation Challenge
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing that comes to mind here is the manipulating objects
          kata, where we had to add Ben as a property to the value of the Terah
          children property. Ben had to be an object with a key name and a value
          "Ben". That whole sentence blew my mind the first time I read it. It
          felt like one of those illusion paintings and the deeper you look the
          more you see.
        </p>
        <p>
          So yeah, I was just like ðŸ™„ looking at this problem. I spoke it out
          loud several times. Wrote it out in smaller steps. Wrote out each part
          of the problem, just really trying to break it down so that my brain
          could comprehend what was happening. I looked at the Object Anatomy to
          understand how Ben had to be an object, but also a property, and
          started building from there.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew Ben had to be an object with a key name and the value Ben. So I
          built the ben object, to visualize it. Then I needed to have that Ben
          object be a part of Terah's children property. So I knew how to add a
          new property that was an object to an existing object using dot
          notation. But I didn't know how to add the Ben object to that
          property. I tried a lot of different things, like:
        </p>
        <img src="/images/Problem Solving 1.png" alt="screenshot of code" />
        <p>and</p>
        <img src="/images/Problem Solving 2.png" alt="screenshot of code" />
        <p>
          but it didn't work. I googled things like How to Add a Property to an
          object in javascript, and add a property to the value of another
          object. I looked at things like the Object defineProperty() Method,
          and how to add a key-value pair to an existing property. Every search
          got me trying different things. But nothing worked as expected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, I turned to chat gpt and gave her my code so far. I asked
          her for help. Quite literally, this is what I typed "help! How do I
          add Ben to Terah as a child?" Clearly, I was desperate ðŸ˜‚ Chat gpt was
          great help, and showed me that I could use dot notation to just
          continue the logic here...
        </p>

        <p>Seeing it like that made so much sense.</p>

          The Art of Elegant Problem-Solving: Capitalizing Strings
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I solved the capitalize problem quite elegantly. I really
          broke it down into its smaller components and quickly realized that
          .map() doesn't work on strings and would need to create an array
          first. I used console.log to log every step while I was problem
          solving this so I could see what every step was doing, which really
          helped as well. I also feel quite happy with my variable names this
          time. Using console.log was also reassuring throughout the problem
          solving as it allowed me to see that I was heading in the right
          direction and gave me confidence while working on this.
        </p>
        <p class="title">Reflecting on Problem-Solving Techniques</p>
        <p>
          I feel pretty confident with most of these, except maybe reading error
          messages and pseudocode. I like the idea of pseudocode as it provides
          a structured approach to problem-solving. However, I think I still
          struggle to write effective pseudocode. While I understand the
          concept, I sometimes find it challenging to translate my thoughts into
          clear and actionable pseudocode. It's an area where I'm working on
          improvement to better plan and organize my code logic. I also have
          mixed confidence when it comes to reading error messages. While some
          error messages are clear and provide helpful information, there have
          been instances where I still struggled to understand the root cause of
          the problem. I recognize the importance of improving my ability to
          interpret error messages effectively. Personally, I do feel like I am
          quite suited to the rubber ducky method as I found it very helpful to
          speak things through out loud to my "rubber ducky" Bulbasaur.
        </p>
        <p class="title">Embracing the Art of Asking for Help</p>
        <p>
          I will say, I do take my time before asking for help, even though I
          feel like I ask a lot of questions. I'll really try to exhaust
          everything before I reach out in discord. Before joining the bootcamp
          I asked my brother (who is a developer) for any tips, and he said
          "don't be afraid to ask questions." And he's right. I believe I will
          only get out of the bootcamp and this experience what I put in, and
          that includes asking as many questions (even if they feel stupid) as I
          need to. That is the beauty of doing the bootcamp, the fact that we
          have the facilitators and other students working alongside us. And
          it's the thing I missed when I was trying to teach myself how to code
          back in the day. Sure, I probably could have reached out in a forum
          like stack overflow, but the context for all of us at this bootcamp is
          the same, which is super helpful.
