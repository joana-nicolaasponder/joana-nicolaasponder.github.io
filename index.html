          <h2>Hi, my name is Joana</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to my little corner of the internet. This is a blog page
            where you can follow along on my Dev Academy journey. I'll be
            updating this with required Dev Academy technical and reflective
            blog posts, plus some personal blog posts throughout my coding
            journey as well. Right now, it's not in the greatest state. But
            that's because I'm building as I learn :) So check in often to see
            how this page evolves. I hope you enjoy!

            to problem solving. Here are some of my thoughts!
